If there's no argv file input (argc ==1), a random file called aAaAaA.txt will be created and automatically interpreted it. 
(called aAaAaA to avoid overwriting common same named files in the computer)

auto.c contains the code that are responsible for outputting a random turtle script.

Since it is random, most of the time, the interpreted text files are usually not interesting, some of the time, it is just one line. 
I tried to change it by changing different likelihood for each instructions. I also did a few 
To change that, I would have to not make it random, but that defeat the whole point of this random turtle text file generator.

Through all the assignments, I had to read pre-written text files, but I have not had to output a textfile through my code.
Therefore for this extension, I want to practice that.

My extension will output a turtle file that complies with all the turtle grammar given for the assignment.
The output will be a random turtle file, so it will be different everytime.

Since if the output file is truly random, even if it complies to grammar, it may not have a meaningful output. 
(e.g. making a -ve do loop, putting nothing inside the do loop, calling FD A when A is not set, polish notatioin may not make sense)

Therefore, I did some fine tuning and played around with it to make the output file more meaningful and are more likely to ouput something that have some output in the SDL.

For example, for <POLISH>, instead of randomly going through the <POLISH> expression, I chose a random number to decide how many numbers to use. 
This allows me to know how many <OP> I need to make a meaningful <POLISH> expression. 
As at least 2 numbers has to come before one <OP> for the expression to make sense, I decided I should put all the random numbers, then the <OP> afterwards.

This is a design decision, and as result, the <POLISH> part is not recursive.
I commented out the part which made the <POLISH> random (but does not make sense in many cases).

Another design decision I made is for the random <VARNUM>.
Although grammar allow and <VARNUM>, but it will be quite pointless to keep calling a variable that are not initialised in the first place.
Therefore I only call <VAR> that has been set earlier.
This is done by keeping track of it, and making it not really 'random'. 

As there are too many potential issues with usage of varnum, especially in the <DO> part of the grammar, I decided for <DO>, for X TO Y, X will always be 1, and Y will be >1.

Another design decision I made is so that it is impossible to have output file like '{ }' where there's nothing inside the text file but the brackets.
I do this by increasing he random number range as it goes along, so that at the first few passes of the function, '}' is not a possible output.
As it goes along, the } output will be more and more likely as the weight shifts.
This is part of my design decision as I don't want the file to be too long.

Different <INSTRUCTION> all has different weights, with FD being the most likely one to be outputted.
I chose the weight so that it is more likely that the output text file will print out something in the SDL interpreter.
However, it is impossible to guarentee that as I still want the output text file to be random to some extent. 

Despite all these, it is still likely in many cases that there will be useless statements (e.g. <SET> at the very end and not called, <DO> with nothing inside).
It was not possible to eliminate all these without restricting the original grammar heavily.
As these issues will not affect the SDL output, I chose to ignore it and allow it.

To make things more visual, the randomly generated file will be automatically ran by the interperter I wrote in part 2.
