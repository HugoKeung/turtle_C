Testing strategy

Function that is being tested (and the function it called) is copy and pasted to the top of a empty test.c to test it individually.
The main then call the function and print out the necessary output.
printf are used to print out the return value (if there's one).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following functions are tested first in the order as stated below.
These are tested first as the arguments for these functions are string. Therefore they can be hard coded into main easily.
These are also very short functions. Excluding the variables initialisation, they are all only 5 lines or so.

int lengthCheck(char* str)
This function should return 0 if the string is longer than 1 character.
Input tested include various characters in various length. That includes number, alphabet and special characters (e.g. '*', '.').
The output was as expected. 
Input like "\n" are also tested, and did not show error as expected.

int isNum(char* str)
This funciton should return 0 if it is not a number, 1 otherwise.
This function use isdigit to test each character in the string seperately. 
At first, this seems like it should work fine, but '1.5' and other decimal numbers caused error.
I had to expand it as it did not take account on numbers with decimal points.
Therefore I changed it so that it will allow '.' input as well. 
But it only allows 1 '.', as it will bot be a valid number if there are 2 '.' in a number.
I also set out a special case so that '.' by itself will give an error as well, as it is also not a valid number. 
'.1' and '1.' are allowed though, as it just assume that they are 0.1 and 1.0 respectively.
Input tested included various characters and numbers, including string mixed with characters and decimal number. (e.g. '1.a').
Result showed that invalid numbers (e.g. '1..1', '2.a') gave out a negative result, as expected.
Upon further testing, I realised that my function did not allow negative number to parse properly.
I had to allow '-' at the start but not '-' stand alone or at any position other than the first. 
++++++++++
As there are too many edge cases, I explored a different way to do it. I finally decided to use strtod function which is a stdlib function to do it.
I hardcoded the string and tested strings like 'a1', -1..', '.-1' etc.
That's because these are the more likely to failed ones as they include '.' and '-' but not in a grammatically correct way.
Test showed that '-.1', '-1.'

int isOp(char* str)
This function should return 0 if it is not a <OP>, and 1 otherwise.
This function used strcmp to check if the string is a <OP> or not.
Input tested include all the <OP> (e.g. "+", "-", "*", "/"), and various other characters next to the <OP> (e.g. "+-", "+1").
As expected, strcmp worked fine, and only the 4 <OP> gave out positive result.

int isVar(char* str)
This function should return 1 if it is [A-Z], and 0 otherwise.
This function called the lengthCheck function that I wrote and tested.
As a variable can only be [A-Z] single character, if lengthCheck failed (the string is longer than 1 character),it is not a Var.
There are 2 main lines in this function. 
The first one is calling lengthCheck (which was already tested).
The second one is calling isupper, to check if the str[0] is a upper cased alphabet or not.
lengthCheck was called before isUpper, as we have to make sure that strings like 'Aa' that may pass our isupper test are eliminated first.
Input tested included numbers, special characters, various upper and lower cased alphabet with various length and a mix of both. (e.g. 'Aa', 'AB', '1', 'A1')
As expected, only [A-Z] passed the test.

int isVarNum(char* str)
This function should return 1 if it is a variable or a number.
isNum and isVar, that are tested above, are both called in this function. 
They are used in an if statement, that if isNum and isVar are false, then it should give a negative result.
Input tested are the same as the ones tested in isNum and isVar.
As expected, both numbers and [A-Z] passed the test. String with a mix of both did not passed.

int isDirection(char* str)
This function should return 1 if it is a valid direction (FD, LT, RT), and 0 otherwise.
strcmp was used to test if the string was a direction or not.
Input tested include all the valid directions, and a few other characters and numbers mixed with the valid direction.
As expected, only the 3 valid direction gave out a positive result.


XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
When doing the interpretation of the parser, I realised that a 1 and 0 respond from isDirection was not enough.
I had to change it so that each direction give out a specific number.





---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The follwing instructions involves using the struct Prog that I made.
I copy and pasted the struct on top of the test.c to test it.

void initialiseProg(Prog* p)
This function set the first character of every wds in the array to '\0' and set the cw counter to 0.
I first tested if the cw counter is properly set to 0, by doing printf("%d ", p.cw); before and after the intialiseProg is called.
The result showed that before intialiseProg was called, the number printed was '4195813', after it was called, the number printed was '0'.
I then tested if the first characters are all set to NULL. If the first character was set to NULL, printf will show nothing.
I wrote a for loop to print out all the words stored in p.wds.
    for (i = 0 ; i < MAXIMUMTOKENS; i++){
      printf("%s \n", p.wds[i]);
    }
Before initialiseProg, it printed out a few weird characters. 
After initialiseProg, as expected, it only printed out new line and nothing else.

void readFile(Prog* p)
This function reads in a text file and put the words into p.wds in order.
First, I tested if the error checked worked. It did worked as it gave out an error when I did not entered an argument when I was running my program.
It also gave out an error when I mistyped the file name.
I made a file which contained text with different symbols, chatracters and numbers mixed together. 
To test if the words in the text files are correctly put into the p.wds array, I used the same for loop that I used to test the initaliseProg function.
First I printed out p.wds after initialiseProg (which is just new lines), then I printed out p.wds after the readFile function was called.
The program printed out the content in the text file. The phrases in the text file that are seperated with a space are printed out individually on the screen.
The diffrent phrase are seperated by a new line as expected.

---------------------------
Most of the following functions are called recursively, or they call each other.
I had to delete the recursive line or the line which called the other function to test it first.
Most of the lines are very trivial, as they are strcmp or different char comparisons.
The most likely issue that we will face is that we might missed out on a p->cw = p->cw+1 (or did an extra one), leading to the code trying to parse the wrong word.
I designed the code so that p->cw = p->cw+1 is called immedately straigt after every word was parsed.
---------------------------

p->cw = p->cw+1
This phrase call called multiple times in the code. Therefore we will test this seperately.
This line moves the cw pointer to the next one.
To test this, I wrote the following function.
    void nextWord(Prog* p){
       p->cw = p->cw+1;
       printf("%d \n", p->cw);
    }
I tested this by first using the initialiseProg function to set everything to default.
I then called the function I wrote above multiple times.
At the end of the test, I print out the p.cw outside the nextWord function, to make sure the cw changed outside of the scope.
The line I used was as following
    printf("%d \n", p.cw);
Testing showed that this line did worked, and it was not changing only a copy of cw, but the actual cw that was initalised in the main.
This was shown as the last number printed inside the nextWord function was the same as the number printed at the end of the main.

void prog(Prog* p)
This function followed the <MAIN> grammar, which is 
    "{"<INSTRUCTLIST>
When I tested this function, I left out the follwing line:
    instructlist(p);
strcmp was used to test if the text file started with '{'.
To test it, I made several text files that started with '{' and some with no space behind the '{'. 
Only the ones with '{' with a space did not print out an error message.
p->cw = p->cw+1 was called after this line, as '{' is read and we can move on to the next character.
The last line of this function tested if p->cw is NULL. This is to check if there are excess characters after the whole thing is parsed.
To test this line, again, short text files are made. It is expected that without the instructlist(p), that p->cw will be 1 when this line is called.
That means the program expect 1 word in this case.
Therefore I tested files with 2 or more words, and some with 1 words.
As expected, only those files with 1 words didn't gave out the excess character message. 
I went further by adding a 2 lines of p->cw = p->cw+1 after the intial one. 
The result showed that only files with 3 characters passed that test. That was to be expected.

void instructlist(Prog* p)
This function followed the <INSTRUCTLIST> grammar, which is
    <INSTRUCTION><INSTRUCTLIST> | "}"
This function called 2 different functions.
It called a function called instruction, which we haven't tested yet, and it also called instructlist (itself) recursively.
We first tested it without the 2 lines that called other functions.
That leaves us with only 1 line, which was using strcmp to test the cw with '}'.
p->cw = p->cw+1 was called after this line as '}' was read and we can move on to the next character.
As '}' terminates the <INSTRUCTLIST> grammar, return was called after that.
The only other potential issue here is if the p->cw is tracking correctly along the parsing route. 
Again, as stated above, I avoided that error by calling p->cw = p->cw+1 every time after every word is parsed.
I put the "}" parsing before the <INSTRUCTION><INSTRUCTLIST> so that they will only be called when the <INSTRUCTLIST> of the current scope is still ongoing.

void instruction(Prog* p)
This function followed the <INSTRUCTION> grammar, which is 
    <FD>|<LT>|<RT>|<DO>|<SET>
It calls 4 different functions, 2 of them which I already tested above.
isDirection and isVarNum are called in a nested if loop.
I tested it by testing this nested if loop seperately.
I put a printf statement after each if condition, so I know if both if conditions are ran.
First I used readFile to read the text file I created, then ran the simplified instruction function (which only contained the nested if loop).
Result showed that both conditions were ran if isDirection is true. Only isDirection is ran if the first word is not valid.
That is to be expected.
Testing text file included phrases like "FD 10", "FD10", "fd 10", "10 FD" which looked similar to the valid grammar.
As expected, only the first phrase of the above passed the test.
I then expanded the testing function, so that it included the strcmp for "DO" and "SET" as the grammar required.
One potential pitfall here is that is that it may not exit the function when either conditions are met. 
To make sure it was working properly, I tested phrases like "SET" and "DO" seperately, and also together.
Test showed that the function do ignore the other if condition if the previous condition was satisfied.

void doFunc(Prog* p)
This function followed the <DO> grammar, which is 
    "DO" <VAR> "FROM" <VARNUM> "TO" <VARNUM> "{" <INSTRUCTLIST>
As we did p->cw = p->cw+1 when we before we go into this function, we start parsing with the second token, <VAR>.
This function calls strcmp and a few functions we tested above in a sequential manner.
p->cw = p->cw+1 was called everytime after a token was parsed.
At the end it call the function instructlist as the grammar stated.
To test it, I wrote a few text files which complies with the rule, and a few which didn't. (e.g. missing out on 1 token, switching the words around).
As expeceted, only the ones which complies to the rule did not gave out error messages.
During initial testing, I left out the instructlist function at first, to make sure the sequential if statements are working properly.
As instructlist above passed the test, I would assume that adding instruclist function will not break the code.

void setFunc(Prog* p)
This function followed the <SET> grammar, which is 
    "SET" <VAR> ":=" <POLISH>
polish function was called at the very end of the function before the return statement.
During initial testing, I left out the polish function line.
Similar to the doFunc tested above, setFunc is also just a series of if statement.
To test it, I wrote a few text files which complies with the rule, and a few which didn't. (e.g. missing out on 1 token, switching the words around).
As expeceted, only the ones which complies to the rule did not gave out error messages.

void polish(Prog* p)
This function followed the <POLISH> grammar, which is 
    <OP><POLISH> | <VARNUM><POLISH> | ";"
This function called itself recursively during the first 2 if conditions in the grammar as seen above. 
To test this function, I wrote a few files with polish grammar that compiles to the rule. (e.g. "1 A 3 + / * +", ", "3 23 1.2", "+ - 12")
I also wrote a few that did not compile with the rule (e.g. "123+", "FD 10" etc.).
As expected, only those that compiled with the rule did not give me error message.


--------------------------------------------------------
At this point, most part of the functions are tested. 
Some other functions that call other functions or are called recursively are not fully tested.
To achieve a full test, I wrote a few files that complie with the overall grammar rule, and a few that did not.
I tried to make that the files that did not complie to the rule are very subtle and and grammar related.
I especially focused on the tokens that are called during/after the bit where the functions are called recursively and when other functions are called.
For example, 
    putting a number after ';'
    putting a extra/missing out on a bracket after the DO loop
    putting extra number after the DO loop

None of the subtly invalid text files gave a positive result.
Therefore I am confident that my code is working 100% correctly, compling to the grammar, and nothing more.
To double check, I compiled my code with -g flag so I can step through it step by step in gdb. 
It showed that tokens are read correctly, one at a time while parsing through the correct relevant function.
